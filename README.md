# Midjourney Style Reference Parameters Database

## Situation

As there are numerous posts on X (formerly Twitter) in the AI art community sharing Midjourney style reference parameters, known as `--sref`, there is an opportunity for the benefit of all to curate and share them in a database.

## Complication

No current database exists that is widely shared.

## Resolution

This project sets out to provide a curated database for users to contribute to the collection of `--sref` parameters.

Users will be able to access the database by signing in and uploading the `--sref` parameter code, for example, `123456`, along with the image file and their X (formerly Twitter) ID, i.e., `@foresaa`.

Users who want to browse can view the database and perform searches.

## Action

This database is in progress and expected to be completed by the end of September 2024.
